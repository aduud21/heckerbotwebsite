            <p><strong>6. Liability</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Australian Users</strong></p>
            <p><em>Limitation of liability</em></p>
            <p>
                Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition,
                warranty, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer
                Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be
                excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent
                permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a
                non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms
                of Use, is limited, at the Owner‚Äôs sole discretion, to the re-performance of the
                services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
            </p>
            <p><strong>US Users</strong></p>
            <p><em>Disclaimer of Warranties</em></p>
            <p>
                This Application is provided strictly on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù basis. Use of
                the Service is at Users‚Äô own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
                law, the Owner expressly disclaims all conditions, representations, and warranties ‚Äî
                whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any
                implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or information, whether oral or
                written, obtained by user from owner or through the Service will create any warranty
                not expressly stated herein.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without limiting the foregoing, the Owner, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors,
                officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers, and employees do not
                warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will
                meet Users‚Äô requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time
                or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected;
                or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content
                downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at
                users' own risk and users shall be solely responsible for any damage to Users‚Äô
                computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or
                Users‚Äô use of the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any
                product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any
                hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way
                monitor any transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or
                services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Service may become inaccessible or it may not function properly with Users‚Äô web
                browser, mobile device, and/or operating system. The owner cannot be held liable for
                any perceived or actual damages arising from Service content, operation, or use of
                this Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the exclusion and
                limitations of certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to
                Users. This Agreement gives Users specific legal rights, and Users may also have
                other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under
                this agreement shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
            </p>
            <p><strong>7. Limitations of liability</strong></p>
            <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and
                its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners,
                suppliers and employees be liable for:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages,
                    including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or
                    other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability
                    to use, the Service; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other
                    unauthorized access or use of the Service or User account or the information
                    contained therein;
                </li>
                <li>any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;</li>
                <li>
                    personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from
                    User access to or use of the Service;
                </li>
                <li>
                    any unauthorized access to or use of the Owner‚Äôs secure servers and/or any and
                    all personal information stored therein;
                </li>
                <li>any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service;</li>
                <li>
                    any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or
                    through the Service;
                </li>
                <li>
                    any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a
                    result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made
                    available through the Service; and/or
                </li>
                <li>
                    the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any User or third party. In no
                    event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors,
                    agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for any claims,
                    proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount
                    exceeding the amount paid by User to the Owner hereunder in the preceding 12
                    months, or the period of duration of this agreement between the Owner and User,
                    whichever is shorter.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by
                law in the applicable jurisdiction whether the alleged liability is based on
                contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if the
                company has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
                consequential damages, therefore the above limitations or exclusions may not apply
                to Users. The terms give User specific legal rights, and User may also have other
                rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions,
                and limitations of liability under the terms shall not apply to the extent
                prohibited by applicable law.
            </p>
            <p><strong>8. Indemnification</strong></p>
            <p>
                The User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries,
                affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and
                employees harmless from and against any and all claims or demands, damages,
                obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses, including, but not
                limited to, legal fees and expenses, arising from:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    User‚Äôs use of and access to the Service, including any data or content
                    transmitted or received by User;
                </li>
                <li>
                    User‚Äôs violation of these terms, including, but not limited to, User‚Äôs breach of
                    any of the representations and warranties set forth in these terms;
                </li>
                <li>
                    User‚Äôs violation of any third-party rights, including, but not limited to, any
                    right of privacy or intellectual property rights;
                </li>
                <li>User‚Äôs violation of any statutory law, rule, or regulation;</li>
                <li>
                    any content that is submitted from User‚Äôs account, including third party access
                    with User‚Äôs unique username, password or other security measure, if applicable,
                    including, but not limited to, misleading, false, or inaccurate information;
                </li>
                <li>User‚Äôs wilful misconduct; or</li>
                <li>
                    statutory provision by User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents,
                    co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees to the extent allowed by
                    applicable law.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>9. No Waiver</strong></p>
            <p>
                The Owner‚Äôs failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not
                constitute a waiver of any such right or provision. No waiver shall be considered a
                further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.
            </p>
            <p><strong>10. Service Interruption</strong></p>
            <p>
                To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt
                the Service for maintenance, system updates, or any other changes, informing users
                in the support discord server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or terminate the
                Service altogether. If the Service is terminated, the Owner will cooperate with
                Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data or information in accordance with
                applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside the Owner‚Äôs
                reasonable control, such as ‚Äúforce majeure‚Äù (e.g., labor actions, infrastructural
                breakdowns or blackouts etc).
            </p>
            <p><strong>11. Severability</strong></p>
            <p>
                Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable
                under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not
                affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force
                and effect.
            </p>
            <p><strong>US Users</strong></p>
            <p>
                Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and
                reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and
                consistent with its original intent. These Terms constitute the entire Agreement
                between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede
                all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between
                the parties with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the
                fullest extent permitted by law.
            </p>
            <p><strong>EU Users</strong></p>
            <p>
                Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable,
                the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid
                and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable
                parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be
                replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the
                applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to
                enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire
                Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such
                importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had
