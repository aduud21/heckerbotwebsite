            <p>
                When using MultipleBot, I store data about your server to bring you a better
                experience (if you use certain features which are said in this privacy policy).
            </p>
            <p>Last Modified October 9, 2023.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>What information do I store from the people that use MultipleBot?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Only public information about your discord server. This is your Server ID, Channel
                ID(s).
            </p>
            <p>
                Server ID and Channel ID(s) are used for the setmodlog (modlog) feature, without
                Server ID/Channel ID(s) MultipleBot cannot send logs of messages as Server ID and
                Channel ID is required to identify your discord server for such feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                For any information sent via the setmodlog feature, the bot will attempt to remove
                personal information from the message (numbers). MultipleBot does not store message
                content in a database for storage and privacy purposes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Anonymous Collection</strong></p>
            <p>
                I may collect the amount (in numbers) of discord servers which use this bot/service.
                This in no way can identify you or your discord server. This information may be used
                for Advertising or such.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How do I use your information?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Your information is used within the bot for features which require said information.
            </p>
            <p>If you have a privacy concern, please contact:</p>
            <p>
                me on discord
                <a href="https://discord.gg/YSEB7PnHVV">https://discord.gg/YSEB7PnHVV</a> and
                explain what the concern is.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Security Measures:</strong></p>
            <p>
                This only applies if modlogs were set up. The data collected is stored in MongoDB
                with a very long password. Only the owner has access to it directly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Agreement</strong></p>
            <p>
                By using MultipleBot, you agree to these terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not
                agree to these terms, you must not use this service.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may delete the data the bot has collected about your server if the bot is in
                your server and you have proper permissions by using this command: /deldata and/or
                kicking the bot from your server while the bot is online.
